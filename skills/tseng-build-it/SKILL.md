# TSEng Build-It

Implements an architectural specification as working code. Takes a spec produced by the spec skill (from a GitHub issue, conversation context, or pasted text) and translates it into concrete TypeScript modules, services, domain objects, events, and routers — following the project's existing conventions and the architecture rules.

The spec defines *what* to build and *where* it belongs. This skill decides *how* to build it.

## Phase 1 — Load Architecture Overview (Progressive Disclosure)

Read only the overview to start — load specific docs lazily as implementation demands:

1. Read `architecture/index.md` from the architecture docs directory (shown above). This gives you the map of all topics without the full weight.

**Do NOT read all architecture files upfront.** Instead, load them on-demand during implementation:

| When you need to...                              | Then read...                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Understand stack/dependency requirements         | `stack.md`                    |
| Implement layer code (routers, services, domain) | `slice-composition.md`        |
| Create or modify modules                         | `modules.md`                  |
| Wire cross-module events                         | `module-boundaries.md`        |
| Place files or create new packages               | `project-structure.md`        |

This keeps context lean. You are the architecture expert — load knowledge just-in-time as the implementation demands it.

## Phase 2 — Load Project State

Read the project's TSEng context to understand where it stands:

1. Check if `tseng/index.md` exists. If it does, read it and follow every link:
   - `tseng/project-structure.md` — package layout, names, paths, server runtime
   - `tseng/adoption.md` — applied, discarded, and remaining changes
   - `tseng/reviews/index.md` — review history
   - The **latest locked review** — to understand current compliance state
2. Read the project's existing module structure by scanning server package `src/modules/` directories and contract package `src/modules/` directories.
3. Check if `tseng/vocabulary.md` exists. If it does, read it — this is the ubiquitous language that the spec was written against. Use these exact terms throughout implementation.

If the project has no `tseng/` directory at all, warn the user that project context is missing and suggest running `/tseng:adopt` first. Do not refuse to proceed — the user may have a good reason — but warn that implementation decisions will be less informed.

Summarize what you found to the user in a brief status:
- How many modules exist and what they are
- Adoption state (how aligned the project is)
- Server runtime and package layout
- Any discarded decisions that may affect implementation

## Phase 3 — Obtain the Specification

Ask the user how they want to provide the spec:

> How would you like to provide the specification?
> 1. **GitHub issue** — give me the issue number or URL
> 2. **From this conversation** — if you just ran /tseng:spec
> 3. **Paste it** — paste the spec text directly

For option 1: Use `gh issue view <number> --json body,title` to fetch the issue. Parse the markdown body to extract the spec sections.

For option 2: Look back in the conversation for the spec output from a prior /tseng:spec invocation. If not found, tell the user and ask for an alternative.

For option 3: Accept the pasted text.

**Validate the spec.** Confirm it contains at minimum:
- Feature Overview
- Affected Bounded Contexts

If sections are missing, ask the user if this is intentional or if the spec is incomplete. A spec without "Domain Events" is valid (single-module feature), but a spec without "Affected Bounded Contexts" is not actionable.

Summarize what you understand from the spec back to the user:
- Which modules will be created or modified
- What events will be wired
- What services will be implemented
- Any areas the spec leaves open that you'll need to decide on

## Phase 4 — Create Implementation Plan

This is where the spec's "what and where" becomes concrete "how". Before writing the plan, discover the project's existing conventions.

### Convention Discovery

Scan existing code in the project for patterns:
- How are existing entities structured? (classes vs plain types + functions)
- How are Result types implemented? (custom type, neverthrow, ts-results, etc.)
- How are services structured? (classes with DI, plain functions, factory functions)
- How are tRPC routers composed? (single router per module, nested routers, etc.)
- How is tRPC context set up? (what's available for DI)
- Naming conventions (camelCase files, PascalCase files, kebab-case files)

If the project has no existing modules, follow the architecture docs' example patterns as the baseline.

### Plan Structure

For each module in the spec, produce a plan that covers:

1. **File structure** — Every file to be created or modified, with full path:
   ```
   modules/<name>/
     domain/
       <EntityName>.ts
       events/<EventName>.ts
     services/<ServiceName>.ts
     routers/<RouterName>.ts
     index.ts
   ```

2. **Domain layer** — Entity names, value object names, aggregate roots. Key type signatures. Invariant enforcement strategy. Event type definitions (the `type` discriminant and payload shape).

3. **Application layer** — Service function names and parameters. Which domain objects each service coordinates. External integration points. How events are published.

4. **Validation layer** — Router procedure names (query/mutation). Zod schema shapes. How domain errors map to tRPC error codes.

5. **Cross-module wiring** — What gets exported from `index.ts`. Event subscription setup. Import paths for cross-module event types.

Present the plan to the user:

> Does this implementation plan look right? Any naming preferences or conventions I should follow differently?

**Wait for confirmation before proceeding.** This is the single approval gate — once the plan is approved, implementation proceeds without interruption.

## Phase 5 — Implement Module by Module

Work through the plan one module at a time, in dependency order:
- Implement modules that **publish** events before modules that **subscribe** to them
- Within each module, implement bottom-up: **domain first, then services, then routers, then index.ts**

### For each module:

**Step 1 — Domain layer:**
- Create entity types, value objects, aggregate roots
- Implement invariant enforcement (validation functions, state transition guards)
- Use Result types for domain errors — match the project's existing Result pattern
- Create domain event type definitions in `domain/events/`
- Create type guards for each event (`is<EventName>` functions)

**Step 2 — Application layer:**
- Create service functions that orchestrate domain operations
- Wire up dependency injection via function parameters (or constructor injection if the project uses classes)
- Implement event publishing (call the event bus/emitter with the domain events)
- Handle external integrations at this layer

**Step 3 — Validation layer:**
- Create tRPC router with Zod input schemas
- Map each use case from the spec to a tRPC procedure (query for reads, mutation for writes)
- Translate domain Result errors into tRPC error responses
- Wire the router into the module's service via tRPC context

**Step 4 — Module boundary:**
- Create/update `index.ts` exporting only event types and type guards
- Nothing else leaves the module boundary

**Step 5 — Integration:**
- Register the module's router with the app router (update the root router composition)
- Wire event subscriptions in subscribing modules
- Update tRPC context if new services need injection

After each module, briefly report what was created:
> Module `orders` implemented: 3 domain types, 2 events, 1 service, 1 router, index.ts exports wired.

## Phase 6 — Verify Implementation

Run three checks:

**1. Type check** — Run `tsc --noEmit` (or the project's equivalent type-check script). If it fails, fix the type errors. Report what was fixed.

**2. Architecture rule check** — For each newly created/modified file, verify:
- Domain files import nothing from services or routers
- Service files import nothing from routers
- No cross-module imports bypass `index.ts`
- Module `index.ts` exports only event types and type guards
- If violations are found, fix them and report.

**3. Spec coverage check** — Walk through the spec section by section and confirm every element was implemented:
- Every module listed in "Affected Bounded Contexts" has corresponding code
- Every domain event listed in "Domain Events" has a type definition, type guard, and is exported
- Every application service listed in "Application Services" exists with the described use cases
- Every invariant listed under bounded contexts is enforced in domain code

Report the verification results to the user. If anything is missing or broken, fix it.

## Phase 7 — Summary

Present a final summary:

**Created/Modified files:** (grouped by module)

**Modules implemented:**
- For each module: what domain concepts, events, services, and routes were created

**Cross-module wiring:**
- Event flow (publisher → event → subscriber)

**Conventions followed:**
- Note any naming conventions, patterns, or project-specific decisions that were made

**Next steps the user should consider:**
- Testing (the spec doesn't prescribe testing strategy — the user should add tests)
- Database/storage integration (if the spec mentioned persistence needs)
- Any TODO comments left in code where external integration details were unknown

## Guidelines

- **The spec is the contract.** Implement everything in the spec. Do not add features the spec doesn't mention. Do not skip features the spec does mention. If something in the spec is ambiguous, ask.
- **Domain first, always.** Within each module, write domain code before services, services before routers. This ensures the inner layers are stable before the outer layers depend on them.
- **Follow existing conventions.** If the project already has modules, match their style exactly — naming, structure, patterns. Consistency trumps personal preference.
- **The architecture docs are the source of truth** for structural rules (layer dependencies, module boundaries, event patterns). Never violate them, even if existing code does.
- **Respect adoption state.** If `tseng/adoption.md` shows certain rules were discarded, do not enforce those rules in new code. Follow what the project has actually adopted.
- **Respect ubiquitous language.** Use the exact terms from `tseng/vocabulary.md` and the spec. If the spec says "Order", write `Order`, not `Purchase`. If the spec says "OrderPlaced", the event is `OrderPlaced`, not `OrderCreated`.
- **Result types for domain errors.** Never throw exceptions from domain code. Use the project's Result type pattern. If no pattern exists, define a simple `Result<T, E> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E }` discriminated union.
- **Pure domain layer.** Zero external dependencies in domain code. No framework imports, no I/O, no side effects. Domain functions are pure and deterministic.
- **Events are the only cross-module contract.** When wiring subscribers, import only from the publishing module's `index.ts`. Never reach into another module's internals.
- **Don't invent infrastructure.** If the spec mentions domain events but the project has no event bus, create the simplest possible in-memory event emitter. Do not add message queues, event stores, or other infrastructure the spec doesn't call for.
- **Leave TODOs for unknowns.** If the spec references an external integration but doesn't detail the API, implement the service function with a clear TODO and a placeholder that shows the expected interface.
- **No tests unless asked.** The spec explicitly leaves testing strategy to the implementer. Don't generate tests unless the user asks. If they do ask, follow the project's existing test patterns.
- **Dependency order matters.** Implement publisher modules before subscriber modules. This ensures event types are available when subscribers need to import them.
- **Start big, split later.** If the spec is large, implement the core module first. Get the domain model right before wiring integrations and events.
