# Modules and Bounded Contexts

The server is organized into **modules**. Each module is a vertical slice that represents a single bounded context from the domain.

## Core Concepts

### Bounded Contexts

A bounded context is a boundary where a specific domain model and language applies. The same real-world concept (e.g., "User") can have different representations in different contexts:

- In **Identity**, a User has credentials, sessions, and login history.
- In **Billing**, a Customer has a payment method, invoices, and a subscription plan.
- In **Shipping**, a Recipient has an address and delivery preferences.

Each bounded context owns its own domain model. There is no single unified model — each context models only what it needs.

### Modules as Vertical Slices

A module is the code-level expression of a bounded context. It is a vertical slice that contains all three architectural layers:

| Lens | What it answers |
|------|----------------|
| **Bounded context** (strategic DDD) | What are the boundaries of this domain model? |
| **Vertical slice** (architecture) | How do we structure the code to reflect that boundary? |
| **Module** (codebase) | What is the folder called? |

These are three views of the same thing. A module maps 1:1 to a bounded context.

**Modules are defined by business boundaries, not technical concerns.** `identity/`, `billing/`, `orders/` are valid modules. `database/`, `middleware/`, `utils/` are not.

## Module Structure

Each module lives under `src/modules/` and contains the full three-layer stack:

```
packages/server/src/
  modules/
    identity/
      routers/          # Validation layer — tRPC + Zod
      services/         # Application layer — business services
      domain/           # Domain layer — pure TypeScript
        events/         # Domain events owned by this module
      index.ts          # Public API — the module boundary
    billing/
      routers/
      services/
      domain/
        events/
      index.ts
    orders/
      routers/
      services/
      domain/
        events/
      index.ts
```

### Intra-Module Rules

Within a module, the standard layer rules apply (see [architecture.md](architecture.md)):

```
routers → services → domain
```

- Routers delegate to services.
- Services coordinate domain objects.
- Domain has zero external dependencies.

### Module Public API (`index.ts`)

Every module has an `index.ts` at its root. This is the **only** entry point other modules may import from. It exports:

- **Domain event types** (as TypeScript types)
- **Domain event type guards** (for narrowing events in subscribers)

Nothing else leaks out. The module's routers, services, entities, value objects, and aggregates are private.

```typescript
// modules/orders/index.ts
export { type OrderPlaced, isOrderPlaced } from './domain/events/OrderPlaced.js';
export { type OrderCancelled, isOrderCancelled } from './domain/events/OrderCancelled.js';
```

## Inter-Module Communication

Modules communicate exclusively through **domain events**. No module may import another module's internals (services, entities, routers). The only cross-module imports allowed are event types and type guards from `index.ts`.

### Domain Events

A domain event is a record of something meaningful that happened in the domain. Events are named in past tense using business language: `OrderPlaced`, `UserRegistered`, `PaymentCompleted`.

#### Ownership

Events are defined in the **publishing module's** domain layer:

```
modules/orders/domain/events/OrderPlaced.ts
```

The publishing module is the single source of truth for the event's shape.

#### Structure

```typescript
// modules/orders/domain/events/OrderPlaced.ts
type OrderPlaced = {
  type: 'OrderPlaced';
  orderId: string;
  items: ReadonlyArray<OrderItem>;
};

const isOrderPlaced = (event: DomainEvent): event is OrderPlaced =>
  event.type === 'OrderPlaced';
```

Every event has a `type` discriminant and a corresponding type guard.

#### Subscribing

A subscribing module imports only the event type and type guard from the publisher's `index.ts`:

```typescript
// modules/shipping/services/onOrderPlaced.ts
import { type OrderPlaced, isOrderPlaced } from '../../orders/index.js';
```

The subscriber knows about the event shape but nothing else about the publishing module's internals.

#### Dependency Direction

```
orders  ──emits──▶  OrderPlaced
                         ▲
shipping ──subscribes────┘
```

- The publishing module (`orders`) knows nothing about its subscribers.
- The subscribing module (`shipping`) depends on the event type from `orders/index.ts`.
- This is a one-way dependency on a stable contract (the event shape), not on implementation details.

### What Is Not Allowed

- Importing a service from another module (`import { createUser } from '../identity/services/...'`)
- Importing a domain entity from another module (`import { User } from '../identity/domain/...'`)
- Importing a router from another module
- Any import that bypasses `index.ts`

## Identifying Bounded Contexts

When designing modules, ask:

1. **Does this area have its own language?** If the team uses different words or the same words with different meanings, it is likely a separate bounded context.
2. **Can this area change independently?** If changes to billing logic should not require changes to shipping logic, they belong in separate modules.
3. **Does this area have its own invariants?** If a set of business rules are cohesive and self-contained, they likely form a bounded context.

Start with fewer, larger modules and split when the language or invariants diverge. Premature splitting creates unnecessary event plumbing.
