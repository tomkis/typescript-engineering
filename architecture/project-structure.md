# Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with workspace support.

## Monorepo Layout

```

## Package Responsibilities

### `packages/server/`

The server package contains the API and all backend logic, organized into the three architectural layers (see `architecture.md`).

**Required dependencies:** `@trpc/server`, `zod`
**Required dev dependencies:** `@types/node`

### `packages/client/`

The client package consumes the API via a typed tRPC client. The UI framework is flexible.

**Required dependencies:** `@trpc/client`

### API contract package

A workspace package that exports the `AppRouter` type and API type definitions for the client to consume. This enables end-to-end type safety without coupling the client directly to server internals. The naming and scope of this package is flexible — it may only re-export types, or it may also contain the router definitions themselves.

## Workspace Configuration

- **pnpm** (default): Uses `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with `packages: ["packages/*"]`
- **npm/yarn**: Uses `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` in root `package.json`
- **bun**: Uses `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` in root `package.json`

## TypeScript Configuration

The root `tsconfig.base.json` provides shared strict settings. Each package extends it:

```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

The server package must add `"types": ["node"]` in its `compilerOptions` since it runs in Node, not the browser.

## Project Metadata (`tseng/project-structure.md`)

After bootstrapping or reviewing, a `tseng/project-structure.md` file records the project layout with machine-readable HTML comments for tooling:

```markdown
<!-- package_manager: pnpm -->
<!-- server_runtime: hono -->
<!-- server_path: packages/server -->
<!-- server_package_name: @myapp/server -->
<!-- client_path: packages/client -->
<!-- client_package_name: @myapp/client -->
<!-- workspace_root: . -->
<!-- workspace_config: pnpm-workspace.yaml -->
```

Valid values for `server_runtime`: `hono` (default), `express`.

This file is the source of truth for other skills that need to locate packages.

## TSEng Index (`tseng/index.md`)

The `tseng/index.md` file is the entry point for all TSEng context in a project. The project's `CLAUDE.md` points here; everything else is discovered through progressive disclosure.

Template (adapt based on which files exist):

```markdown
# TSEng

This project follows the TypeScript Engineering architecture.

## Project Metadata
See [project-structure.md](project-structure.md) for workspace layout, package manager, and server runtime.

## Adoption Progress
See [adoption.md](adoption.md) for applied, discarded, and remaining architecture changes.

## Review
See [review-checklist.md](review-checklist.md) for the latest architecture audit checklist.
```

Only include sections for files that actually exist. For a bootstrapped project, only "Project Metadata" will be present. For an adopted project, "Adoption Progress" will also appear.
