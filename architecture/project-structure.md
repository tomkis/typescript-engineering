# Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with workspace support.

Package names are **not enforced** — projects may use any naming convention (e.g., `api-server`, `backend`, `web`, `ui`, `dashboard`). What matters is the role (server vs client) and the internal structure, not the directory name. A project may also have multiple server or client packages.

## Package Responsibilities

### Server packages

Each server package contains an API and backend logic, organized into modules. Each module is a bounded context expressed as a vertical slice containing the four architectural layers (see [slice-composition.md](slice-composition.md) and [modules.md](modules.md)). A project may have one or more server packages.

**Required dependencies:** `@trpc/server`, `zod`, `rxjs`
**Required dev dependencies:** `@types/node`

### Client packages

Each client package consumes an API via a typed tRPC client. The UI framework is flexible. A project may have one or more client packages.

**Required dependencies:** `@trpc/client`

### API contract package

A workspace package that defines the API contract: router types, router implementations, and service interfaces. The client consumes the `AppRouter` type for end-to-end type safety. The naming and scope of this package is flexible.

Contract packages have a **flat module structure** — no layers. Each module contains:

- **Types + service interface** — Zod schemas, input/output types, and the service interface that defines the contract between the router and its implementation.
- **Router** — tRPC router that accepts a service implementation and delegates all calls to it. Contains no business logic.

The service interface naming convention is not prescribed (e.g., `*Service`, `*Context`, or any other pattern). What matters is that the project is consistent — file names, interface names, and variable names should all agree within a project.

The server package then implements the service interfaces defined in the contract package. This keeps the contract decoupled from business logic — the contract says *what* operations exist, the server says *how* they work.

### Other packages

The monorepo may contain packages that fall outside the scope of this architecture (e.g., packages in a different language, shared utilities, infrastructure tooling). These should be listed in `tseng/project-structure.md` under the `other` role so the architecture is aware of them but does not attempt to enforce rules on them.

## Workspace Configuration

- **pnpm** (default): Uses `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with `packages: ["packages/*"]`
- **npm/yarn**: Uses `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` in root `package.json`
- **bun**: Uses `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` in root `package.json`

## TypeScript Configuration

The root `tsconfig.base.json` provides shared strict settings. Each package extends it:

```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

The server package must add `"types": ["node"]` in its `compilerOptions` since it runs in Node, not the browser.

## Project Metadata (`tseng/project-structure.md`)

After bootstrapping or reviewing, a `tseng/project-structure.md` file records the project layout with machine-readable HTML comments for tooling.

Each package is listed with a `role` (`server`, `client`, `contract`, or `other`), its `path`, and its `package_name`. Multiple packages of the same role are supported.

```markdown
<!-- package_manager: pnpm -->
<!-- workspace_root: . -->
<!-- workspace_config: pnpm-workspace.yaml -->

<!-- package: api-server | role: server | runtime: hono | path: packages/api-server | package_name: @myapp/api-server -->
<!-- package: ui | role: client | path: packages/ui | package_name: @myapp/ui -->
<!-- package: dashboard | role: client | path: packages/dashboard | package_name: @myapp/dashboard -->
<!-- package: api-types | role: contract | path: packages/api-types | package_name: @myapp/api-types -->
<!-- package: scripts | role: other | path: packages/scripts | package_name: @myapp/scripts -->
```

Valid values for `runtime` (server packages only): `hono` (default), `express`, `standalone`.

This file is the source of truth for other skills that need to locate packages.

## TSEng Index (`tseng/index.md`)

The `tseng/index.md` file is the entry point for all TSEng context in a project. The project's `CLAUDE.md` points here; everything else is discovered through progressive disclosure.

Template (adapt based on which files exist):

```markdown
# TSEng

This project follows the TypeScript Engineering architecture.

## Project Metadata
See [project-structure.md](project-structure.md) for workspace layout, package manager, and server runtime.

## Adoption Progress
See [adoption.md](adoption.md) for applied, discarded, and remaining architecture changes.

## Ubiquitous Language
See [vocabulary.md](vocabulary.md) for domain terms scoped by bounded context.

## Review History
See [reviews/index.md](reviews/index.md) for the full history of architecture reviews. Each review is an immutable record that is locked once finalized.
```

Only include sections for files that actually exist. For a bootstrapped project, "Project Metadata" and "Review History" will be present. For an adopted project, "Adoption Progress" will also appear.
