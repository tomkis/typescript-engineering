# TypeScript Engineering Architecture

Opinionated architecture for TypeScript client-server projects. Read this overview first to understand the full picture, then drill into specific files for details.

## Topics

- **[Stack](stack.md)** — Technology choices: tRPC, Zod, Hono/Express, strict TypeScript, pnpm. Server runtime, client setup, dev proxy, shared types.
- **[Architecture](architecture.md)** — Three-layer DDD model: validation (tRPC routers) → application (services) → domain (pure TS). Dependency rules, error handling.
- **[Modules](modules.md)** — Bounded contexts as vertical slices. Module isolation, domain events for inter-module communication, public API boundaries.
- **[Project Structure](project-structure.md)** — Monorepo layout, package responsibilities, workspace config, TypeScript config, project metadata format.
